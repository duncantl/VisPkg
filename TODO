+ labels not positioned correctly in a pdf() graphics device. Too low so below the box

+ Rectangles rather than lines for the top-level types?  and remove the gaps between the lines/rectangles.
   + the can vectorize the color argument.

+ [check] Identify S3 generics - have to look in the body not just isFunAssign

+ Identify S3 methods - either from NAMESPACE, getNamespace() or based on names but not knowing what classes there are.
   + √ find NextMethod

+ [check] added name column to data.frame for top-level elements

+ allow mapping of colors in call or do we do this on the Toplevel

+ add legend for colored/top-level plot.
   + in separate are on side of plot or in the plot area.
   + part of showFiles.ToplevelTypeInfoList as a call to mkLegend.
```
ty = getToplevelTypes("~/GitWorkingArea/Rllvm/R")
plot(ty[!grepl("z_enum", names(ty))])
legend(1, .4, legend = names(TypeColorMap), fill = TypeColorMap)
```
```
plot(ty[!grepl("z_enum", names(ty))])
types = unique(unlist(lapply(ty, `[[`, "type")))
m = match(types, names(TypeColorMap))
legend(1, .4, legend = names(TypeColorMap)[m], fill = TypeColorMap[m])
```

+ allow ordering the rectangles by overall size of each file.
   + user can order them if they compute the information ahead of the call.
      showFiles(lnz[order(sapply(lnz, length))], cex = .7, lwd = 4, lend = 1, mar = 4); title("Rllvm", line = 3)
   + but order = TRUE/FALSE     

+ cex etc. for labels
   - take into account for computing margin.
   - √ passed to mkEmptyPlot()

+ Class hierarchies

+ Other "line" information measures
  - changes to lines
  
+ 2 plots above and below for many files.

+ Exporting information to JavaScript do display there.
 or htmlwidgets?...

+ √ lwd doesn't seem to work any more.
   - wasn't passing ... to drawLines() call in showFileOutlines() now that it is doing the drawing again.
